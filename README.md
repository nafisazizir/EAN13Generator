# EAN 13 Barcode Generator
Program for printing EAN-13 barcodes on computer screen and saving the image as a PostScript (.eps) file

## Description
An EAN-13 barcode (originally European Article Number) is a barcoding standard which is a superset of the original 12-digit Universal Product Code (UPC) system developed in North America. The EAN-13 barcode is defined by the standards organisation GS1. All the numbers encoded in UPC and EAN barcodes are known as Global Trade Item Numbers (GTIN). The EAN-13 barcodes are used worldwide for marking products often sold at retail point of sale. For example, 8992759515466 is the EAN 13 barcode for facial tissue. This project is a Tkinter GUI-based object-oriented Python program for generating EAN-13 barcodes and saving the image as a PostScript file.
